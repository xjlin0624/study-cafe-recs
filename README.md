## hello ! you will find the perfect cafe for studying and working [here](study-cafe-recs.onrender.com) :D

this is a cafe recommendation app where users can add their own cafe finds onto the page and leave reviews for the crowd! 

information about wifi connection, space, and price for a basic americano is required for the input, which are the main things i personally consider when i look for a place to study. 


### cafes 

[here](https://study-cafe-recs.onrender.com/cafes) is a list of cafes that have been added by users of the platform! there is a cluster map displaying all their locations up top. click on a specific cafe to explore!

### new cafe

[here](https://study-cafe-recs.onrender.com/cafes/new) useres can input and create a new cafe after they have registered and logged in with an account. let's grow the list!!

### live chat <small>(to be implemented)</small>

the vision is to have live chatting feature so users can ask people currently at the cafe (who have this platform open) questions about space, any events going on, etc.
