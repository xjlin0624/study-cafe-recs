## hello ! you will find the perfect cafe for studying and working [here](study-cafe-recs.onrender.com) :D

this is a cafe recommendation app where users can add their own cafe finds onto the page and leave reviews for the crowd! 

information about wifi connection, space, and price for a basic americano is required for the input, which are the main things i personally consider when i look for a place to study. 

------------------------------

### cafes 

[here](https://study-cafe-recs.onrender.com/cafes) is a list of cafes that have been added by users of the platform! there is a cluster map displaying all their locations up top. click on a specific cafe to explore!
